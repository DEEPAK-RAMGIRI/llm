tell me about deepak,"i'm Ramgiri Deepak Kumar, a B.Tech CSE student at SR University with a 9+ GPA. I’m skilled in Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and tools like Git, GitHub, AWS, and MySQL, with experience in NLP, AI, and full-stack development. My portfolio showcases my projects, and I use cloud platforms like Vercel to manage and deploy them. I enjoy learning new technologies and building projects that solve real-world problems. You can explore more about my work at deepakramgiri.tech."
tell me about foodies,"Foodies: A Hotel Online Restaurant is a modern, single-page restaurant website built using React.js. It features a responsive design that works smoothly across all devices. A chatbot powered by Dialogflow is integrated to handle common user queries like placing orders or checking the menu. The site includes animated sections for pages like Home, Menu, and Contact, with dynamic text effects using Typed.js to enhance engagement. It’s deployed on Vercel with fast load times and high uptime, and the entire project is managed through GitHub for organized version control."
hi how did deepak made you,"The project implements a question-answering system where user inputs are converted into vector embeddings using Hugging Face models. The reference data is stored in a CSV file, which is loaded using CSVLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders. This data is embedded using Instructor Embeddings and stored in ChromaDB to enable fast and efficient similarity search.When a user submits a query, it is transformed into a vector and compared with the vectors stored in ChromaDB. The most relevant information is retrieved using LangChain's RetrievalQA module. The results are passed to Gemini GPT Flash, an LLM integrated via PromptTemplate, to generate accurate responses, even for multi-question inputs. Environment variables are used to securely manage API keys and sensitive credentials."
tell me about song recommendation Sytem,"My Song Recommendation System is a content-based filtering project that suggests similar songs using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. I worked with a Kaggle dataset, applied text preprocessing (tokenization and stemming with NLTK), and converted the data into vectors for comparison. To handle large data efficiently, I stored processed results in Pickle files and built a simple Streamlit frontend for user interaction. I also integrated Spotipy (Spotify Web API) to fetch real music metadata. This project gave me strong hands-on experience in NLP and building recommendation systems."
what are the skills does deepak have ?,"Skilled in Python, Java, and C for programming, and experienced in building websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Worked with tools like Git, GitHub, and Vercel for version control and deployment. Has hands-on experience in NLP and AI, including TF-IDF, embeddings, cosine similarity, and chatbot development I am skilled in Python, Java, and C, which gives me a strong base in problem-solving and application development. I also have experience in web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, along with deployment and version control through Git, GitHub, and Vercel. On the AI side, I’ve worked with NLP and built chatbots using Dialogflow, and I’m also familiar with LangChain for LLM-based applications. I often use Google Colab for experimentation and have hands-on experience in deploying full projects online, which has helped me connect development with real-world usage.using Dialogflow. Familiar with LangChain and  Google Colab and also handling, and deploying full projects online."
what  are the technologies used in your portfolio,"My portfolio was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and responsive interface. I used Typed.js for animated text effects and deployed the site on Vercel. It also showcases the projects I’ve worked on, which you can explore by visiting deepakramgiri.tech"
what are the difficulties faced and whata are the learnings I learned from this foodies project,"While building the Foodies website, a functionality issue was encountered where some buttons were not triggering correctly. By using the React Developer Tools, the issue was identified and fixed. Through this, an important concept in React was learned—how to trigger specific functions based on user interactions, which played a key role in smoothly connecting the chatbot to the website.

To make the chatbot smarter, multiple intents were created in bulk so it could understand different types of user queries—a process known as intent classification. For example, if a user says “onigiri” or “rice ball,” the bot recognizes both as the same food item by using entities with synonyms.

A database was also set up to manage menu items, pricing, and order tracking. The chatbot, built with Dialogflow, was connected to this database using FastAPI in Python. Since Dialogflow only works over secure connections, Ngrok was used to tunnel the local development server into a secure HTTPS endpoint.

Another major challenge was managing multiple users using the chatbot at the same time, which could cause data conflicts. This was solved by using Dialogflow’s session IDs combined with regular expressions, allowing each user's session to be handled separately without confusion."
difficulties and learnings from this llm ,"While building the custom LLM, several challenges came up:
Dependency Issues: Even after installing the right packages, some were either outdated or too new, leading to errors. Everything worked fine in Google Colab, but running it locally in Python caused problems. This was solved by learning to set up a virtual environment.

Data Preparation: Creating a large amount of personal data (like project details and chatbot inputs) manually was time-consuming and repetitive.

API Management: Managing sensitive keys was tricky at first, but a valuable new concept learned was using .env files to safely store API keys and keep them secure.

difficulties and learnings from this Song Reccomendation system,"During this project, I faced difficulties in handling a large dataset (~50k rows), which was heavy on CPU and slowed down text preprocessing. To overcome this, I optimized the data by working with a subset of 20k rows and used Pickle to store processed results, saving time and resources by avoiding repeated computation. Another challenge was the large Pickle file size (~6GB), which could not be uploaded to GitHub, so I stored it on Google Drive and showcased results through screenshots. From these challenges, I learned how to optimize datasets, efficiently preprocess text for NLP, persist data using Pickle, and explore real-world APIs like Spotipy. These learnings helped me strengthen my skills in NLP, data handling, and building deployable ML applications."
