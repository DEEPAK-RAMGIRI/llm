Project Goal

Create a web-based tool where users paste code snippets in multiple languages, and an LLM provides:

Bug fixes

Performance improvements

Explanations

Step-by-Step Roadmap
Week 1: Planning & Setup

Define Scope & Features

Supported languages: Python, Java, C, JavaScript (start with 2–3, expand later)

Features: Fix bugs, optimize code, explain logic, highlight errors

Set up Node.js Backend

Use Express.js for server

Integrate OpenAI API or any LLM API for code understanding

Set up Frontend

HTML/CSS/JS or React for UI

Text area for code input

Buttons: “Analyze Code” / “Explain Code” / “Optimize Code”

Display area for results

Week 2: Core Functionality

Backend API Design

POST /analyze → receives code + language + task type

Sends request to LLM API with instructions like:

"Analyze this Python code, find bugs, suggest improvements, and explain it step by step."

Frontend-Backend Connection

Use Axios / Fetch to send code snippets to backend

Display response in a readable format (syntax highlight with Prism.js)

Test with Sample Code

Start with simple snippets

Ensure LLM correctly identifies issues and explains code

Week 3: Advanced Features

Multi-Language Support

Add language selection dropdown

Adjust prompts for each language

Code Highlighting & Formatting

Display original code with fixes highlighted

Optional: allow copy of improved code

User Experience Improvements

Loading indicator while LLM responds

Error handling if API fails or code is too long

Week 4: Testing & Deployment

Testing

Test multiple programming languages

Edge cases: syntax errors, large code snippets, complex logic
